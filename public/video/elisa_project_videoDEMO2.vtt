00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:04.622
Most business owners are stuck in a cycle of manual work that drains

2
00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:09.383
their most valuable resource, time. Every minute you spend manually calculating

3
00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.296
a quote for a lead is a minute you aren't spending growing your business

4
00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:17.135
or working with clients. For this professional batch cooking business,

5
00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:21.645
we turned a manual chore into an instant self-service experience.

6
00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:28.014
On top of this custom website, I built this interactive pricing tool so

7
00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:32.555
the client get an immediate accurate quote based on their specific selection and needs.

8
00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:36.608
Instead of the owner acting as a human calculator,

9
00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.696
the system does the math automatically.

10
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.831
And the moment a client hits submit,

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.880
the lead is captured. The system takes over,

12
00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.626
meaning zero manual data entry and no more back and forth emails just to

13
00:00:49.627 --> 00:00:52.905
confirm a price. Behind the scenes,

14
00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:57.452
I've built a custom automation engine that acts as a 24 7 digital

15
00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:01.157
assistant to ensure absolute privacy and security.

16
00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:05.880
The entire system is securely hosted on private European servers,

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.115
keeping all the client's data safe and compliant with EU laws.

18
00:01:11.648 --> 00:01:15.828
We've automated the three of the most exhausting parts of the business to free

19
00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.482
up the owner's flexibility. Every new inquiry is

20
00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:23.607
automatically categorized and stored in a central database.

21
00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:27.051
No more searching through inbox to find a client's phone number.

22
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.396
When a session is booked, the system automatically audits

23
00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:37.045
their accounting records. It recognizes returning clients and making them feel

24
00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:39.769
valued, and pulls their latest pricing data,

25
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.972
ensuring that the bill is always 100% accurate.

26
00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:48.559
The system then cross-references the booking and prepares everything for payment,

27
00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:53.133
entirely bypassing the need for manual spreadsheets or handwritten notes.

28
00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:58.121
the real value is in the seamless experience the client sees.

29
00:01:59.388 --> 00:02:02.375
This system connects the business owner's calendar,

30
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.257
email, accounting system, and secure payments into one unified

31
00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:12.056
flow. The business owner receives all the client's information automatically

32
00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:14.465
with their contact information.

33
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:17.440
For the client, they get an immediate,

34
00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:22.691
personalized response. With a link to book their own slot based

35
00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:24.914
on real-time availability. No more,

36
00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:28.560
are you free on Tuesday texts. Once they pick a time,

37
00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:33.422
the system triggers the second phase, a professional payment email with a secure

38
00:02:33.423 --> 00:02:38.039
payment link so they can pay instantly and

39
00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.278
the correct invoice is already attached.

40
00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.599
Lastly, they receive a confirmation email.

41
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.160
This whole experience is automated,

42
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:51.201
deeply personalized, making the owner and the business look

43
00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.580
professional, organized, and efficient.

44
00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:57.984
The business owner hasn't manually sent a single email,

45
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.001
yet the session is booked, the invoice is generated,

46
00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:05.632
and the payment is secured. We've just brought back hours of the week while

47
00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.668
providing a high-end experience to the clients.

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.313
I don't just build websites or AI automation, I build autonomous systems that give

49
00:03:15.314 --> 00:03:20.308
business owners their lives back. I can take the manual administration

50
00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:22.750
and repetitive work off your hands,

51
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.153
so you have more time to grow your business, reach more clients,

52
00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.519
and do what you do best. Click the link on my website and schedule
