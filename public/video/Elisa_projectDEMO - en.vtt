00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:04.841
Every business eventually hits a wall where the admin starts

2
00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.726
taking more and more time away from actual work.

3
00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:11.159
For this project, we focused on operations and finance.

4
00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.848
I want to show you how we took a messy manual process,

5
00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:17.993
onboarding, invoicing, profit tracking,

6
00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.179
and we turned it into a hands-off automated system that gave a local business

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.267
in the French Alps more than 500 hours back,

8
00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:30.632
every year. Let's look under the hood and see how this actually works for

9
00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.006
the business owner. It starts here.

10
00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:37.057
I built this custom website to act as a 24-7 salesperson.

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.505
It doesn't just look good, but also makes the business look and feel professional.

12
00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:46.781
It's the front door to a machine that works while the owner sleeps.

13
00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:49.665
Instead, I'm setting up a messy contact form.

14
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:55.096
The client uses this cost simulator. They build their own quotes and

15
00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:59.037
see their savings instantly. No more what's-your-price emails.

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.238
They already know. The moment the client hits submit,

17
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.861
the lead is captured and the system takes over,

18
00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:09.837
meaning zero manual data entry.

19
00:01:09.983 --> 00:01:12.203
The owner hasn't even opened her laptop yet.

20
00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:15.221
And here we can see,

21
00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:19.454
immediately, the lead lands here.

22
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:23.058
Boom. No typos,

23
00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.651
no lost notes, the business is now organized by default.

24
00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.223
Every detail the owner needs is captured into one clean row.

25
00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.434
Seconds later, the client gets this.

26
00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:39.064
A personalized welcome email. With a direct link to the owner's calendar.

27
00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:43.927
The client books their own spot. The system just finished an hour of work

28
00:01:43.928 --> 00:01:48.501
in five seconds. And it also notifies the business owner about the new

29
00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:51.208
interested clients. And for the best part,

30
00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:55.655
getting paid. Once they book, the system sends a bill with a professional payment

31
00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.669
email and a secure payment link.

32
00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:00.331
So they can pay instantly.

33
00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:02.701
And the correct invoice already attached.

34
00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:08.551
Cash flow automated. I

35
00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:11.017
built this profit calculator for the business owner.

36
00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:15.876
It tells the owner exactly how much she makes per hour after taxes

37
00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:18.182
and costs. And she can adjust everything.

38
00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:22.865
She doesn't have to hope that she's making money or spend

39
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.662
time manually calculating. She knows.

40
00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.774
We took 12 hours of weekly manual work and turn it into zero.

41
00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:34.886
That's more than 500 hours a year.

42
00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.497
You get back for your family, for your business,

43
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.352
of your life. If your business feels like a

44
00:02:43.353 --> 00:02:45.835
mess of manual tasks, let's fix it.

45
00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:48.459
I'm Gabriel and I don't just build things.

46
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.468
I don't websites or work with AI.

47
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:55.206
I can take repetitive tasks off your hands so you have more time to

48
00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:57.428
grow your business, reach more clients,

49
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.473
and do what you do best. Click the link on my website and let's

50
00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:02.198
get your time back.
